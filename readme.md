## Function vs Aliases

In general aliases are short commands that can be used in place of longer more verbose single line unix commands. They can not accept arguments. They pre-pend to whatever you type in the shell after them.

Functions are more complex logical pieces of bash code that can take any number of arguments and insert them them where needed.
